bebe had been very close to her father .
the remark came from a well - meaning family friend , but bebe found it more cutting than comforting .
“ his death wasn’t for the best , ” she kept repeating to herself .
it was clear that when bebe recounted the incident in a book years later , she was still grieving .
as bebe came to see , it can take a long time for someone to overcome grief , especially when the bereaved person was very close to the deceased .
in the bible , death is aptly described as “ the last enemy . ”
it breaks into our lives with irresistible force , often when we are completely unprepared , and it robs us of those we hold dear .
none of us are immune to its ravages .
so it is not surprising if we feel at a loss when it comes to coping with death and its aftermath .
perhaps you have wondered : ‘ how long does it take to get over grief ?
how can i comfort others who have been bereaved ?
is there any hope for our loved ones who have died ? ’
have you ever had a brief bout with illness ?
as an example , consider how the patriarch abraham reacted when his wife died .
the bible says that “ abraham began to mourn and to weep over sarah . ”
the expression “ began to ” suggests that it took some time for him to cope with his loss .
he grieved for “ many days , ” and his family members were unable to comfort him .
several years later , the death of joseph still weighed heavily on his mind . ​ — genesis 23 : 2 ; 37 : 34 , 35 ; 42 : 36 ; 45 : 28 .
“ my husband , robert , died on july 9 , 2008 .
six years later the pain in my heart is still there .
i don’t think i will ever get over my loss of rob . ” ​ — gail , aged 60 .
“ although i have been without my dear wife for more than 18 years , i still miss her and grieve over my loss .
whenever i see something in nature that is attractive , my thoughts go to her , and i cannot help wondering how she would have enjoyed seeing what i am seeing . ” ​ — etienne , aged 84 .
clearly , such painful and long - lasting feelings are only natural .
each person grieves in his or her own way , and it would be unwise to judge the way another person responds to tragedy .
at the same time , we may need to hold off from condemning ourselves if our reaction to loss seems excessive .
as we note in the “ imitate their faith ” article in this issue , isaac was still grieving over the loss of his mother , sarah , three years after her death . ​ — genesis 24 : 67 .
for instance , you may find that some will advise you not to cry or show your feelings in any way .
others may push you to do the opposite and expose all your feelings .
the bible presents a more balanced view , one that is supported by modern research .
in some cultures it is considered unmanly for a male to cry .
but is there a real need to feel ashamed about shedding tears , even in public ?
mental - health experts acknowledge that tearfulness is a normal part of grieving .
and grieving may , in time , help you to move on despite the enormity of your loss .
suppressing grief , however , may do more harm than good .
the bible lends no support to the notion that it is wrong or unmanly to shed tears of grief .
at the death of his dear friend lazarus , jesus openly wept , even though he had the power to bring the dead back to life ! ​ — john 11 : 33 - 35 .
bouts of anger are often part of grieving , especially in cases of sudden , unexpected death .
there are many reasons why a bereaved person may feel angry , such as when thoughtless and unfounded comments are made by a respected person .
“ i was only 14 years old when my father died , ” explains a south african man named mike .
“ at the funeral , the anglican minister said that god needs good people and takes them early .
* this angered me because we desperately needed our father .
especially in the case of unexpected death , the bereaved person may repeatedly think , ‘ it might not have happened if only i had done this or that . ’
if you are being plagued by such feelings of guilt and anger , it is important not to bottle up these emotions .
rather , speak to a friend who will listen and reassure you that such irrational feelings are common to many bereaved ones .
the bible reminds us : “ a true friend shows love at all times , and is a brother who is born for times of distress . ” ​ — proverbs 17 : 17 .
the best friend a bereaved person can have is our creator , jehovah god .
pour out your heart to him in prayer because “ he cares for you . ”
moreover , he promises that all who do so will have their thoughts and feelings soothed by “ the peace of god that surpasses all understanding . ”
also , allow god to help you heal by means of his consoling word , the bible .
having such thoughts to ponder over may be especially helpful at night when you are alone and find it hard to sleep . ​ — isaiah 57 : 15 .
recently , a 40 - year - old man , whom we will call jack , lost his beloved wife to cancer .
“ when i pray to jehovah , ” he explains , “ i never feel alone .
i often wake up during the night and cannot get back to sleep .
after reading and meditating on comforting thoughts from the scriptures and then pouring out the feelings of my heart in prayer , i sense a calmness and a transcending peace come over me , putting my mind and heart at rest and enabling me to sleep . ”
a young woman named vanessa lost her mother to illness .
she too has experienced the power of prayer .
“ in my most difficult times , ” she says , “ i would just call on god’s name and break down in tears .
jehovah listened to my prayers and always gave me the strength i needed . ”
some bereavement counselors advise those who are struggling with grief to get involved in helping others or to volunteer their time in some community service .
doing so can bring joy and may ease a person’s grief .
many bereaved christians have found that working to help others has brought them great comfort . ​ — 2 corinthians 1 : 3 , 4 .
god feels for you in your pain . ​ — psalm 55 : 22 ; 1 peter 5 : 7 .
god patiently listens to the prayers of his servants . ​ — psalm 86 : 5 ; 1 thessalonians 5 : 17 .
god misses people who have died . ​ — job 14 : 13 - 15 .
god promises to resurrect the dead . ​ — isaiah 26 : 19 ; john 5 : 28 , 29 .
have you ever felt helpless when someone near to you was grieving over the loss of a loved one ?
sometimes we may feel unsure of what to say or do ​ — so we wind up saying and doing nothing .
but there are practical , helpful things that we can do .
often , all that is needed is your presence along with a simple expression , such as “ i am so sorry . ”
in many cultures , giving the person a hug or a gentle squeeze of the arm is an effective way to show you care .
if the bereaved one wants to talk , listen sympathetically .
best of all , do something for the bereaved family , perhaps performing a chore the grieving one has not been able to care for , such as cooking a meal , caring for the children , or helping with funeral arrangements if that is desired .
such actions may speak louder than the most eloquent words .
in time , you may be moved to talk about the deceased , perhaps focusing on some good qualities or happy experiences .
such conversation may even bring a smile to the bereaved person’s face .
for example , pam ​ — who lost her husband , ian , six years ago — ​ says : “ people sometimes tell me good things that ian did that i never knew about , and that makes my heart feel good . ”
researchers report that many bereaved people receive a lot of initial help but that their needs are soon forgotten as friends get busy again with their own lives .
therefore , make a point of contacting a bereaved friend on a regular basis after the loss .
* many grieving ones deeply appreciate this opportunity to relieve themselves of prolonged feelings of grief .
consider the example of kaori , a young japanese woman who was devastated by the loss of her mother followed by the loss of her older sister 15 months later .
thankfully , she received ongoing support from loyal friends .
one named ritsuko is much older than kaori and offered to be her close friend .
“ to be honest , ” says kaori , “ i wasn’t happy about that .
i didn’t want anyone to take the place of my mother , and i didn’t think that anyone could .
however , because of the way mama ritsuko treated me , i came to feel close to her .
every week , we went out in the evangelizing work together and went to christian meetings together .
she invited me to have tea with her , brought me meals , and wrote me letters and cards many times .
mama ritsuko’s positive attitude had a good influence on me . ”
twelve years have passed since kaori’s mother died , and today she and her husband are full - time evangelizers .
“ mama ritsuko , ” kaori says , “ continues to show her concern .
when i go back home , i always visit her and enjoy her upbuilding association . ”
another example of someone who benefited from ongoing support is poli , one of jehovah’s witnesses in cyprus .
poli had a kind husband , sozos , who set a good example as a christian shepherd by often inviting orphans and widows to their home for association and a meal .
sadly , at the age of 53 , sozos died of a brain tumor .
there , they began associating with a congregation of jehovah’s witnesses .
“ the friends in my new congregation , ” recalls poli , “ did not know anything about our past and our difficult circumstances .
but that did not stop them from approaching us and embracing us with their kind words and practical help .
how precious that help was , especially at that time , when my son needed his father most !
those taking the lead in the congregation showed a great deal of personal interest in daniel .
one in particular made sure to include daniel when enjoying association with friends or when going out to play ball . ”
both mother and son are doing well today .
to be sure , there are many ways we can offer practical help and comfort to those who mourn .
the bible also comforts us by means of a thrilling hope for the future .
some have even marked the date of the death on their calendar as a reminder to offer comfort when it may be most needed ​ — on or near the date of the loss .
you may recall that gail , mentioned earlier in this series , doubts whether she will ever get over the death of her husband , rob .
however , she is looking forward to seeing him again in god’s promised new world .
my feelings really go out to people who have lost someone they love but who are not aware of this hope of seeing their loved one again . ”
soon , god will do just that ​ — for job and countless others — ​ when this earth is transformed into a paradise .
“ there is going to be a resurrection , ” the bible confirms at acts 24 : 15 .
“ do not be amazed at this , ” jesus assures us , “ for the hour is coming in which all those in the memorial tombs will hear his voice and come out . ”
he will have the prospect of regaining “ his youthful vigor , ” and his flesh will forever remain “ fresher than in youth . ”
the same will happen to all who respond with appreciation to god’s merciful provision of a resurrection to life on earth .
if you have suffered the loss of someone dear to you , the information we have discussed may not completely take away your grief .
but by meditating on god’s promises found in the bible , you can find real hope and the strength to keep going . ​ — 1 thessalonians 4 : 13 .
would you like to learn more about how to cope with grief ?
or do you have related questions , such as “ why does god allow evil and suffering ? ”
please visit our website , jw.org , to see how the bible gives comforting , practical answers .
“ god . . . will wipe out every tear from their eyes , and death will be no more . ” ​ — revelation 21 : 3 , 4 .
this issue of the watchtower discusses how god will fulfill that promise and what it can mean for you .
cover subject | why did jesus suffer and die ?
in the spring of 33 c.e . , jesus the nazarene was executed .
he had been falsely charged with sedition , savagely beaten , and nailed to a stake .
but god raised him back to life , and 40 days later , jesus ascended to heaven .
this extraordinary account comes to us from the four gospels of the christian greek scriptures , commonly called the new testament .
on the other hand , if those events really did happen , then there is a bright future for mankind , one in which you can share .
so , are the gospel accounts fact or fiction ?
unlike fanciful legends , the gospel writings reflect painstaking accuracy and attention to detail .
for example , they abound with names of real places , many of which can be visited today .
they tell about real people , whose existence has been corroborated by secular historians . ​ — luke 3 : 1 , 2 , 23 .
jesus himself is mentioned by secular writers of the first and second centuries .
* his manner of death , as described in the gospels , agrees with roman executional methods of the time .
moreover , events are related in a factual and candid manner ​ — even portraying some of jesus ’ disciples unfavorably .
all these factors strongly indicate that the gospel writers were honest and accurate in what they wrote about jesus .
while it is generally accepted that jesus lived and died , some would question his resurrection .
even his apostles did not believe the initial report of his having returned to life .
all doubt was removed , however , when they and other disciples saw the resurrected jesus on separate occasions .
in fact , in one case , there were more than 500 eyewitnesses present . ​ — 1 corinthians 15 : 6 .
at the risk of being arrested and killed , the disciples courageously proclaimed jesus ’ resurrection to all ​ — even to the very ones who had executed him .
would so many disciples have been so bold if they were not absolutely sure that jesus had really been resurrected ?
in fact , the reality of the resurrection of jesus is the driving force behind the impact that christianity has had on the world both then and now .
the gospel accounts of jesus ’ death and resurrection bear all the necessary marks of an authentic historical record .
carefully reading them will convince you that these events really happened .
your conviction can be further strengthened when you understand why they took place .
tacitus , born about 55 c.e . , wrote that “ christus , from whom the name [ christians ] had its origin , suffered the extreme penalty during the reign of tiberius at the hands of one of our procurators , pontius pilatus . ”
jesus is also referred to by suetonius ( first century ) ; jewish historian josephus ( first century ) ; and pliny the younger , governor of bithynia ( early second century ) .
then , too , it is unlikely that jesus ’ many opposers would write anything that would lend credibility to the reports about him .
regarding jesus ’ resurrection , peter , one of his apostles , explained : “ god raised this one up on the third day and allowed him to become manifest , not to all the people , but to witnesses appointed beforehand by god , to us , who ate and drank with him after his rising from the dead . ”
matthew’s gospel tells us that when the religious enemies heard reports of jesus ’ resurrection , they schemed to suppress them . ​ — matthew 28 : 11 - 15 .
does this mean that jesus wanted his resurrection to be kept secret ?
no , for peter went on to say : “ he ordered us to preach to the people and to give a thorough witness that this is the one decreed by god to be judge of the living and the dead . ”
true christians have done and are doing just that . ​ — acts 10 : 42 .
“ through one man [ adam ] sin entered into the world and death through sin . ” ​ — romans 5 : 12
what would you say if you were asked , “ do you want to live forever ? ”
most people would probably say that they want to but that they feel it is unrealistic to consider it .
death is a normal part of life , they say , the natural outcome of our existence .
suppose , though , that the question were turned around and you were asked , “ are you ready to die ? ”
under normal circumstances , most people would answer no .
the bible shows that god created humans with the desire and the will to live .
in fact , it says that “ he has even put eternity in their heart . ” ​ — ecclesiastes 3 : 11 .
the reality , though , is that humans do not live forever .
furthermore , has god done anything to remedy the situation ?
the bible’s answers are heartening , and they have a direct bearing on why jesus suffered and died .
the first three chapters of the bible book of genesis tell us that god set before the first human couple , adam and eve , the prospect of unending life and told them what they would have to do to gain it .
then the account describes how they failed to obey god and lost that prospect .
the story is told simply ​ — so simply that some are quick to dismiss it as folklore .
but genesis , like the gospels , gives every indication of being a factual , historical record .
what has been the result of adam’s failure to obey ?
the bible answers this way : “ through one man [ adam ] sin entered into the world and death through sin , and so death spread to all men because they had all sinned . ”
he thus lost the prospect of endless life and eventually died .
being his descendants , we have inherited his sinful condition .
but has god done anything to remedy the situation ?
yes , god made arrangements to redeem , or buy back , what adam had lost for his descendants , namely , the prospect of endless life .
“ the wages sin pays is death , ” says the bible at romans 6 : 23 .
this means that death is the consequence of sin .
likewise , we sin and are therefore subject to sin’s wages , death .
but we were born in this sinful condition through no fault of our own .
so god lovingly sent his son , jesus , to accept ‘ the wages of sin ’ for us .
jesus ’ death opens the way to a happy , endless life
since one man , the perfect man adam , brought sin and death on us through disobedience , a perfect man obedient even till death was needed to release us from that burden .
the bible explains it this way : “ just as through the disobedience of the one man many were made sinners , so also through the obedience of the one person many will be made righteous . ”
he left heaven , became a perfect man * , and died in our behalf .
as a result , it is possible for us to have a righteous standing with god and gain the prospect of endless life .
why , though , was it necessary for jesus to die to accomplish this ?
could not almighty god have simply issued a decree that adam’s descendants be allowed to live forever ?
had god set justice aside in this instance , people might have wondered whether he would do so in other matters as well .
for example , would he be fair in determining who among adam’s offspring qualify for eternal life ?
could he be trusted to keep his promises ?
god’s adherence to justice in working out our salvation is assurance to us that he will always do what is right .
by jesus ’ sacrificial death , god opened the way to endless life in paradise on earth .
note jesus ’ words as recorded at john 3 : 16 : “ god loved the world so much that he gave his only - begotten son , so that everyone exercising faith in him might not be destroyed but have everlasting life . ”
jesus ’ death is thus an expression not only of god’s unfailing justice but , more specially , of his great love for humans .
however , why did jesus have to suffer and die in the painful way that was described in the gospels ?
by subjecting himself to the extreme test and remaining faithful , jesus refuted once and for all the devil’s claim that humans would not remain loyal to god when under trial .
that claim might have seemed valid after satan induced perfect adam to sin .
but jesus ​ — who was adam’s perfect equivalent — ​ remained obedient despite severe suffering .
he thus proved that adam too could have obeyed god if he had chosen to do so .
by enduring under trial , jesus left us a model to follow .
god rewarded his son’s perfect obedience , granting jesus immortal life in heaven .
jesus indicated what we need to do when he said : “ this means everlasting life , their coming to know you , the only true god , and the one whom you sent , jesus christ . ” ​ — john 17 : 3 .

would you say that the devil is . . .
a symbol of the evil inside a person ?
the devil conversed with and “ tempted ” jesus .
what else can we learn from the bible ?
the devil was originally a holy angel , but “ he did not stand fast in the truth . ”
he became a liar and rebelled against god .
other angels joined satan’s rebellion . ​ — revelation 12 : 9 .
the devil blinds many people to his existence . ​ — 2 corinthians 4 : 4 .
some people say that control by the devil is a hoax , while others dread being possessed by evil spirits .
“ the whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one . ”
the devil exerts great influence over mankind , but he does not control every human .
the devil uses deception to increase his influence . ​ — 2 corinthians 11 : 14 .
wicked spirits can in some cases take control of people . ​ — matthew 12 : 22 .
with god’s help , you can successfully “ oppose the devil . ” ​ — james 4 : 7 .

( read ephesians 3 : 5 - 8 . )
why can we say that the “ good news of the kingdom ” is the same as the good news of “ the undeserved kindness of god ” ?

why is it good news for people to learn that they can pray to jehovah ?
many people pray because it makes them feel good , but they do not really believe that god hears their prayers .

13 , 14 . ( a ) what marvelous privileges will the anointed have in the future ?

but another scroll was opened ; it is the scroll of life .
the dead were judged out of those things written in the scrolls according to their deeds .
and the sea gave up the dead in it , and death and the grave gave up the dead in them , and they were judged individually according to their deeds . ”
what should we keep in mind when sharing in our witnessing work ?
the bible says : “ the creation itself will also be set free from enslavement to corruption and have the glorious freedom of the children of god . ”
he also says : “ write , for these words are faithful and true . ”
when we zealously preach this good news to others , we truly glorify jehovah’s undeserved kindness !
“ keep seeking [ god’s ] kingdom , and these things will be added to you . ” ​ — luke 12 : 31 .
what difference is there between what we need and what we want ?

15 , 16 . ( a ) what do we learn from the way jehovah cares for the lilies of the field ?

why should we not worry about what might happen in the future ?
can you simplify your life to focus more on the kingdom ?

( b ) what can you do to simplify your life ?
what will help you to draw closer to jehovah ?
illustrate why it is important to be aware of what time it is and what is happening around us .
why did jesus tell his disciples to “ keep on the watch ” ?
why do we pay attention to jesus ’ warning ?
( a ) why can we believe that jesus now knows when armageddon will occur ?
( b ) although we do not know when the great tribulation will begin , what can we be sure of ?
when on earth , jesus said : “ concerning that day and hour nobody knows , neither the angels of the heavens nor the son , but only the father . ”
( read habakkuk 2 : 1 - 3 . )
give an example to show that jehovah’s prophecies are always fulfilled right on time .
jehovah’s prophecies have always been fulfilled right on time !
sometime later , jehovah told abraham : “ know for certain that your offspring will be foreigners in a land not theirs and that the people there will enslave them and afflict them for 400 years . ”

jesus warned us : “ keep ready , because at an hour that you do not think likely , the son of man is coming . ”
how is the spirit of the world affecting mankind , and how can we avoid that dangerous influence ?
what warning do we find at luke 21 : 34 , 35 ?
( read luke 21 : 34 , 35 . )
what happened to peter , james , and john , and how might that happen to us too ?
according to luke 21 : 36 , how did jesus instruct us to “ keep awake ” ?
how can we make sure that we are ready for what is coming in the near future ?
[ 1 ] ( paragraph 14 ) see chapter 21 of the book god’s kingdom rules !
do not be anxious , for i am your god .
during an assembly , a brother asked me if i would like to preach .
we went to the territory , and he gave me some booklets about god’s kingdom .
one of the sisters there gave us children bible lessons based on the bible and the book the harp of god .
as a teenager , i enjoyed giving people hope from god’s word .
the brother stopped his bicycle and asked me to sit down with him on a log .
he said : “ who gave you authority to judge who is a goat ?
let’s just be happy giving people the good news and leave the judging to jehovah . ”
another older brother taught me that to find happiness in giving , we sometimes have to endure patiently .
years later , his patience was rewarded when his wife was baptized as one of jehovah’s witnesses .
after the war , i pioneered for two years in southern ireland .
we did not realize how much power the priests had .
i had never sailed before , so i was excited .
for five years , we preached mainly on isolated islands where there were no witnesses .
the crew of missionaries aboard the sibia ( left to right ) : ron parkin , dick ryde , gust maki , and stanley carter
often , they gave us fresh fish , avocados , and peanuts .
then at dusk we rang the ship’s bell .
it was lovely to see how seriously some of them took their assignment .
when we arrived , i met and fell in love with maxine boyd , a beautiful missionary sister .
so i said to myself , ‘ ronald , if you want this girl , you’ve got to act quickly . ’
after three weeks i proposed , and after six weeks we were married .
maxine and i were assigned as missionaries to puerto rico , so i never went out on the new boat .
for example , in the village of potala pastillo , there were two witness families with many children , and i used to play the flute for them .
i asked one of the little girls , hilda , if she wanted to come and preach with us .
we bought her a pair , and she came preaching with us .
she was about to leave for her assignment in ecuador , and she said : “ you don’t recognize me , do you ?
i am the little girl from pastillo who had no shoes . ”
at first , lennart johnson and i did most of the work .
nathan knorr , who was then taking the lead among jehovah’s witnesses , came to puerto rico .
later , he gave me strong counsel about being organized and said that he was disappointed in me .
father did not accept the truth when mother and i did .
my dear wife , maxine , died in 2011 .
i am really looking forward to seeing her again in the resurrection .
after 60 years on the island , i felt as puerto rican as a coquí , the popular little puerto rican tree frog that sings ko - kee , ko - kee at dusk .
some who come to see me want to discuss personal or family problems .
everything we do at bethel is sacred service .
wherever we serve jehovah , we have opportunities to praise him .

the soldier could see that the man was drunk , so he told him , “ go home and sober up ! ”
he owned two barbershops in wichita , and the doctor was one of his clients !

we would also go camping with them and would have very enjoyable conversations around the campfire .
we arranged to have some who were in the full - time ministry stay in our home .

so they did stay free until they were at least 23 .
at the same time , brian and kimberly were invited to work at london bethel and later were transferred to malawi bethel .
the day after we left for the watchtower educational center in patterson , linda called to tell us that mother had died .

after going through those regions and giving many words of encouragement to the ones there , he arrived in greece . ”
( read hebrews 10 : 24 , 25 . )
( read 1 thessalonians 5 : 12 , 13 . )
they are a real source of encouragement . ”
andreas , who has two children , says : “ encouragement helps children to grow up spiritually and emotionally .
even though our kids know what is right , doing the right thing becomes their way of life through our constant encouragement . ”
( read luke 21 : 1 - 4 ; 2 corinthians 8 : 12 . )
( read revelation 2 : 18 , 19 . )

( read 3 john 9 , 10 . )
( read matthew 5 : 23 , 24 ; 18 : 15 - 17 . )

have you been using jw.org in your ministry and in your family worship ?
and the brochure who are doing jehovah’s will today ?
what are some reasons why we should be thankful to jehovah ?
there are many reasons why we should be thankful to jehovah !
it also shows how the hope of a reward benefits us .
i was only eight years old at the time .
my father did not want my mother to talk to me about what she was learning .
however , i was curious and asked questions , so she studied with me when my father was out of the house .
as a result , i too decided that i wanted to dedicate my life to jehovah .
my mother said that i should first speak to the servant to the brethren ( now called a circuit overseer ) .
he said , “ go for it ! ”
after four months , i selected a brother as my pioneer partner .
my mother pioneered with a sister in another congregation .
in 1951 , i filled out an application to attend the watchtower bible school of gilead .
while there , i received my invitation to the 22nd class of gilead .
i then traveled by train to south lansing , new york , where the school was located .
with janet on one of the many islands in the philippines
we still serve at the branch office in quezon city
how can you experience “ the peace of god ” ?
how can the congregation help you to reduce anxiety ?
( see opening picture . ) ( b ) what will we consider in this article ?
how , though , can you do that ?
the psalmist david begged jehovah : “ listen to my prayer , o god . ”
when we are anxious , why is prayer so important ?
( read matthew 11 : 28 - 30 . )
what did jesus mean when he said : “ never be anxious ” ?
he admitted : “ my anguished heart makes me groan aloud . ”
( see the box “ some practical ways to reduce anxiety . ” )
how can the meaning of god’s name strengthen your faith ?
his very name is understood to mean “ he causes to become . ”
“ anxiety in a man’s heart weighs it down , but a good word cheers it up . ”
why can you be confident that your relationship with god will strengthen you ?
( a ) how can we throw our anxiety on god ?
how can we be sure that jehovah rewards his servants ?
how did jehovah bless his servants in the past ?
1 , 2 . ( a ) how are love and faith connected ?
( b ) what questions will we consider ?
how , though , does the hope of a reward benefit us ?
jesus showed that his disciples would be rewarded for their sacrifices ( see paragraph 5 )
the apostle peter once asked jesus : “ we have left all things and followed you ; what , then , will there be for us ? ”
in the sermon on the mount , jesus said : “ rejoice and be overjoyed , since your reward is great in the heavens , for in that way they persecuted the prophets prior to you . ”
moses told the nation of israel : “ jehovah will surely bless you in the land that jehovah your god is giving you to possess as an inheritance , but only if you strictly obey the voice of jehovah your god and carefully observe all this commandment that i am giving you today .
for jehovah your god will bless you just as he has promised you . ”
and he named the second one ephraim , for he said , ‘ god has made me fruitful in the land of my affliction . ’ ”
god’s word explains : “ for the joy that was set before him he endured a torture stake , despising shame . ”
jesus certainly found joy in being able to sanctify god’s name .
how does jehovah feel about what we do for him ?
“ the one showing favor to the lowly is lending to jehovah , and he will repay him for what he does . ”
what comfort do we find at 1 john 3 : 19 , 20 ?
( read 1 john 3 : 19 , 20 . )
what are some of the rewards that we enjoy now ?
how do jehovah’s servants feel about the rewards they receive ?
for example , bianca from germany says : “ i cannot thank jehovah enough for helping me with my worries and for being at my side each day .
the world out there is chaotic and bleak .
but as i work closely with jehovah , i feel secure in his arms .
whenever i make personal sacrifices for him , he gives me back a hundredfold in blessings . ”
for my own encouragement , i keep a notebook with scriptures and thoughts from our publications that i can consult from time to time .
i call it ‘ my survival notebook . ’
discouragement is temporary if we focus on jehovah’s promises .
jehovah is always there to help us , regardless of our circumstances . ”
yet , you can likely think of ways in which jehovah has rewarded you and those around you .
how were paul and others set free from sin and death ?
( read romans 6 : 1 , 2 . )

the first article explains what modesty is and what it is not .
how does jehovah expect us to use our abilities ?
clearly , jehovah wants us to do what we can to benefit ourselves and others .

opposition to our preaching ( see paragraphs 6 - 9 )
6 , 7 . ( a ) what could noah not do ?
( b ) how are we in a situation similar to noah’s ?
we too live in a world filled with wickedness , which we know jehovah has promised to destroy .
in the meantime , we cannot force people to accept the “ good news of the kingdom . ”
what noah could do : instead of giving up because of what he could not do , noah focused on what he could do .
when that happened , how did david react ?
past sins ( see paragraphs 11 - 14 )
11 , 12 . ( a ) after he sinned , what could david not do ?
what david could not do : david could not undo what he had done .
he had to trust that when he truly repented , jehovah would forgive him and help him endure the consequences of his actions .
( read james 5 : 14 - 16 . )
he had to leave the matter in jehovah’s hands .
( read luke 21 : 1 - 4 . )

( read isaiah 63 : 11 - 14 . )
and “ the spirit of jehovah began to empower david . ”

11 , 12 . ( a ) what were joshua and the kings who ruled god’s people required to do ?
“ as soon as the king heard the words of the book of the law , he ripped his garments apart . ”

shortly after jesus was baptized , “ angels came and began to minister to him . ”
hours before his death , “ an angel from heaven appeared to him and strengthened him . ”
how did god’s word guide jesus ’ life and teaching ?
it is in vain that they keep worshipping me , for they teach commands of men as doctrines . ”
nobody is good except one , god . ”
“ instantly the angel of jehovah struck him , because he did not give the glory to god , and he was eaten up with worms and died . ”
what will we discuss in the next article ?
i am with you all the days until the conclusion of the system of things . ”
the next article will consider the answers to those questions .
this may have been the original document written by moses .
why was this selection so important to them and to jehovah ?
as a governing body , they gave direction to all the congregations . ​ — acts 15 : 2 .
5 , 6 . ( a ) how did holy spirit empower the governing body ?
( c ) how did god’s word guide the governing body ?
first , holy spirit empowered the governing body .
third , god’s word guided the governing body .
why can we say that jesus led the early christians ?
( a ) when did jesus appoint “ the faithful and discreet slave ” ?
in 1919 , three years after brother russell’s death , jesus appointed “ the faithful and discreet slave . ”
the july 15 , 2013 , issue of the watchtower explained that “ the faithful and discreet slave ” is a small group of anointed brothers who make up the governing body .
so how can we answer jesus ’ question : “ who really is the faithful and discreet slave ? ”
how has holy spirit helped the governing body ?
( read 1 corinthians 2 : 10 . )
( read revelation 14 : 6 , 7 . )
what is one way to remember the governing body ?
why are you determined to follow our leader , jesus ?
when jesus returned to heaven , he did not abandon his followers .
soon , he will lead us to everlasting life .
since 1955 , that corporation has been known as the watch tower bible and tract society of pennsylvania .
jehovah “ comforts us in all our trials ”
“ i have spoken , and i will bring it about .
1 , 2 . ( a ) what has jehovah revealed to us ?
the very first words of the bible make this simple but profound statement : “ in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth . ”
( c ) what questions will we consider ?
and why is jesus ’ ransom sacrifice the key that unlocks the door for god’s purpose to be accomplished ?
what are some gifts that jehovah gave adam and eve ?
it was as if he were saying : ‘ you mean you cannot do what you want ? ’
but jehovah is faithful to his own standards ; he never violates them .
( read deuteronomy 32 : 4 , 5 . )
why is the ransom such a precious gift ?
jehovah provided the ransom at great cost to himself .
when will jehovah become “ all things to everyone ” ?
( read psalm 40 : 8 - 10 . )
how can we show that we love jehovah’s name ?
( read 1 peter 1 : 15 , 16 . )

he accepts as his worshippers those who dedicate themselves to him .
what did jesus mean when he next said : “ let your will take place ” ?
how does the ransom benefit humans who have died ?
what is god’s will for the “ great crowd ” ?
( a ) what blessings do we now receive from jehovah ?
( read acts 3 : 19 - 21 . )
jehovah gives us far more than just the gift of life .
“ we have come to know and believe the love that god has for us .
and should we at times change a decision that we have made ?
this article will help us to answer those questions .
yet , jehovah viewed those kings as having a complete heart .
will god view us as having a complete heart , despite mistakes we make ?
we lived on a small farm in eastern south dakota .
farming was an important part of our family’s life , but it was not the most important part .
my parents got baptized as jehovah’s witnesses in 1934 .
my dad , clarence , and later my uncle alfred , served as company servant ( now called coordinator of the body of elders ) in our small congregation in conde , south dakota .
my sister , dorothy , and i became kingdom publishers when we were six .
conventions and assemblies were an important part of our lives .
the bible says : “ the one walking with the wise will become wise , ” and there were many wise ones in my family who supported my decision to pioneer .
when they were serving congregations nearby , they sometimes invited me to go with them in the ministry .
as a new bethelite , with a farm truck
the farm on staten island included the radio station wbbr .
only 15 to 20 members of the bethel family were assigned to the farm .
most of us were young and quite inexperienced .
brother peterson did his work at bethel well but never neglected the field ministry .
with angela in 1975 , before a television interview
three years later , we were invited to bethel .
why do jehovah and christ deserve to be honored ?
humans were created “ in god’s image . ”
8 , 9 . ( a ) how do jehovah’s witnesses view government officials ?
( read 1 timothy 5 : 17 . )
moreover , do not call anyone your father on earth , for one is your father , the heavenly one .
neither be called leaders , for your leader is one , the christ .
but the greatest one among you must be your minister .
whoever exalts himself will be humbled , and whoever humbles himself will be exalted . ”
( read hebrews 13 : 7 , 17 . )
why should others not make decisions for us ?
( a ) to make wise decisions , we should have faith in what ?
what will help us to make wise decisions ?
( read james 1 : 5 - 8 . )
( read 2 corinthians 1 : 24 . )
loving elders help others learn to make their own decisions ( see paragraph 11 )
elders too should take time to do research .
will it bring joy and peace to my family ?
and will it show that i am patient and kind ? ’
why does jehovah expect us to make our own decisions ?
what does it mean to serve jehovah with a complete heart ?
which of the four kings would you like to imitate , and why ?
( read 2 chronicles 14 : 11 . )
what would your heart move you to do ?

( read 2 chronicles 34 : 1 - 3 . )
( read 2 chronicles 34 : 18 , 19 . )
( b ) what will we discuss in the next article ?

( read 2 chronicles 16 : 7 - 9 . )
( read 2 chronicles 32 : 31 . )
many praise him for what he has done .
( read 2 chronicles 35 : 20 - 22 . )
the bible says that necho’s words were “ from the mouth of god . ”
let us meditate on these bible accounts and be thankful that jehovah has provided them for us !
how many vows have you made to jehovah ?
what about your dedication vow or your marriage vow ?
when we believe that we have personally experienced or observed an injustice , our faith , humility , and loyalty may be tested .
“ the world is passing away and so is its desire , but the one who does the will of god remains forever . ” ​ — 1 john 2 : 17 .
what will jehovah do about wicked people and corrupt organizations ?
the bible says : “ the world is passing away . ”
there is no darkness or deep shadow where wrongdoers can conceal themselves . ”
later in the same psalm , we read : “ the righteous will possess the earth , and they will live forever on it . ”
who are “ the meek ” and “ the righteous ” ?
why can we be sure that the new earth will be well - organized ?
after armageddon , will there be any organization on earth ?
so the “ new earth ” will be organized .
what kind of wrong activities are common where you live , and how are you and your family affected ?
what do we learn from jehovah’s judgment of sodom and gomorrah ?
( read 2 peter 2 : 6 - 8 . )
( read psalm 46 : 8 , 9 . )
what are some things that will be gone forever after armageddon ?
illustrate . ( b ) how can we be sure that we will remain after this old world is gone ?
“ will the judge of all the earth not do what is right ? ”
because jehovah is the greatest example of justice and righteousness .
christians expect to experience some injustice outside the christian congregation .
in 1946 , he attended the eighth class of gilead school in new york , u.s.a .
after graduation , he was eventually assigned to the circuit work in switzerland .
what examples will we consider in this article and in the next ?
in this article , we will consider abraham’s great - grandson joseph and his experience with his brothers .
10 , 11 . ( a ) what injustices did joseph experience ?
( read matthew 5 : 23 , 24 ; 18 : 15 . )
loyalty to jehovah and to our brothers will protect us from making such a mistake .
most important , he did not allow the imperfections and wrong actions of others to separate him from jehovah .
why should we draw even closer to jehovah if we experience injustice in the congregation ?
how can we show that we have confidence in “ the judge of all the earth ” ?
what will we consider in the next article ?
see willi diehl’s life story , “ jehovah is my god , in whom i will trust , ” in the november 1 , 1991 , issue of the watchtower .
( see opening pictures . ) ( b ) what questions will be answered in this article ?
they are excellent examples for men and women today who choose to make vows to jehovah .
what lessons can we learn from jephthah and hannah ?
2 , 3 . ( a ) what is a vow ?
( b ) what do the scriptures say about making vows to god ?
he should do everything he vowed he would do . ”
( a ) how serious is it to make a vow to god ?
( b ) what do we want to learn about jephthah and hannah ?

( b ) what did hannah’s vow mean for samuel ?
she took samuel to high priest eli at the tabernacle in shiloh and said : “ it was for this boy that i prayed , and jehovah granted my petition that i asked of him .
the second most important vow that a person can make is the marriage vow .
what does the bible say about divorce and separation ?
( read 1 corinthians 7 : 10 , 11 . )
one couple said : “ since we have been studying this brochure , our marriage has been happier than ever . ”
we are doing much better now as a couple . ”
18 , 19 . ( a ) what have many christian parents done ?
( b ) what can be said about those who are in special full - time service ?
special full - time service vow ( see paragraph 19 )
it is not the people but their assignments that are viewed as special .
see the appendix article “ the bibleʼs view on divorce and separation ” in the book “ keep yourselves in godʼs love . ”
does the almighty care that you are righteous , or does he gain anything because you follow the course of integrity ? ”
( b ) how did israel defeat jabin’s army ?
( read judges 4 : 14 - 16 . )
the torrent of kishon washed them away . ”
see the article “ anxiety about money ” in the july 1 , 2015 , issue of the watchtower .
1 , 2 . ( a ) what injustice did naboth and his sons experience ?
( b ) what two qualities will we consider in this article ?
what kind of man was naboth , and why did he refuse to sell his vineyard to king ahab ?
naboth was faithful to jehovah at a time when most israelites were following the bad example of king ahab and his wife , wicked queen jezebel .
read 1 kings 21 : 1 - 3 .
he respectfully explained : “ it is unthinkable , from jehovah’s standpoint , for me to give you the inheritance of my forefathers . ”
why would humility have been a protection to naboth’s family and friends ?
( read deuteronomy 32 : 3 , 4 . )
( b ) in what ways will humility protect us ?
how will you respond if the elders announce a decision that you do not agree with ?
what account will we now consider , and why ?
how was peter corrected , and what questions arise ?
in fact , he was later inspired to write two letters that became part of the bible .
3 helping “ foreign residents ” to “ serve jehovah with rejoicing ”
the second article considers how applying bible principles will help immigrant parents to make decisions that will benefit their children .
“ we could see people running , shooting .
my parents and 11 of us siblings fled for our lives with only the clothes on our backs .
how did jesus and many of his disciples become refugees ?
he said : “ when they persecute you in one city , flee to another . ”
( b ) are living in a camp ?
my feet were so swollen that i told my family to go on without me .
my father ​ — not about to abandon me to the rebel forces — ​ carried me .
they gossiped , drank , gambled , stole , and were immoral . ”
( read 1 john 3 : 17 , 18 . )
( b ) why do they need our patient help ?
they need to see that we care about them .
( b ) how can refugees show gratitude ?
how can we help our brothers and sisters who are refugees ?
( a ) what temptation do refugees need to resist ?
finally , he held up the empty bag and said with a smile : ‘ you see ?
this is all you need ! ’ ” ​ — read 1 timothy 6 : 8 .
they need to sense jehovah’s love and compassion among their fellow christians .
many of today’s refugees come from countries where our preaching work is restricted .
( b ) what will we consider in the following article ?
she said : “ the brothers there treated them like close relatives , providing food , clothes , shelter , and transportation .
who else would welcome strangers into their home just because they worship the same god ?
only jehovah’s witnesses ! ” ​ — read john 13 : 35 .
as soon as possible after a refugee arrives , elders should follow the direction in organized to do jehovah’s will , chapter 8 , paragraph 30 .
in the meantime , they can ask discreet questions about a refugee’s congregation and ministry to discern his spiritual condition .
“ no greater joy do i have than this : that i should hear that my children go on walking in the truth . ” ​ — 3 john 4 .
how can parents set a good example for their children ?
how can family heads decide which language congregation the family will attend ?
how can others help immigrant parents and their children ?
1 , 2 . ( a ) what problem do many immigrant children experience ?
( b ) what questions will this article discuss ?
“ but after i started school , i began to prefer the local language .
within a few years , the shift was complete .
i couldn’t understand the meetings , and i didn’t identify with my parents ’ culture . ”
3 , 4 . ( a ) how can parents set a good example for their children ?
( b ) what should parents not expect of their children ?
when your children see you “ seeking first the kingdom , ” they learn to depend on jehovah for their daily needs .
never get so busy that you do not have time for your children .
how may your children benefit from learning your language ?
parents , if that describes your children , can you learn at least some of the local language ?
a child who communicates best in another spoken language deserves the same concern , would you not agree ?
if that is your situation , you can still help your children to come to know and love jehovah .
“ but when we saw her studying , praying , and doing her best to conduct family worship every week , we understood that getting to know jehovah was very important . ”
how can parents help children who may need to study in two languages ?
( a ) who must decide which language congregation to attend ?
that may not be the case when children do not fully understand the language .
( read 1 corinthians 14 : 9 , 11 . )
the answer was not what we personally found convenient .
but when we saw that they were getting little benefit from the meetings in our language , we decided to move to the local - language congregation .
together , we regularly attended meetings and shared in the ministry .
we also invited local friends to join us for meals and excursions .
all of this helped our children to get to know the brothers and to get to know jehovah , not only as their god but also as their father and friend .
we considered this to be much more important than their mastering our language . ”
samuel adds : “ to keep ourselves spiritually strong , my wife and i also attended meetings in our language .
life was very busy , and we were tired .
but we thank jehovah for blessing our efforts and sacrifices .
our three children are all serving jehovah in the full - time ministry . ”
“ i knew the basics of my parents ’ language , but the language spoken at the meetings was over my head , ” recalls kristina .
“ when i was 12 , i attended a convention in my school language .
for the first time , i understood that what i was hearing was the truth !
another turning point came when i began to pray in my school language .
i could speak to jehovah from my heart ! ”
young people , do you think that you would prefer being part of a local - language congregation ?
“ when my siblings and i got into our teens , we wanted to switch to the local - language congregation , ” says nadia , who now serves at bethel .
“ now we’re grateful that our parents worked hard to teach us their language and kept us in the foreign - language congregation .
it has enriched our lives and broadened our opportunities to help others get to know jehovah . ”
( b ) how can parents get help in teaching their children the truth ?
( read proverbs 1 : 8 ; 31 : 10 , 27 , 28 . )
still , parents who do not know the local language may need help to reach their children’s heart .
both children and parents benefit from association with the congregation ( see paragraphs 18 , 19 )
( b ) what must parents continue to do ?
“ when they helped me with student talk assignments for the meeting , i always learned more .
and i enjoyed the leisure activities we shared in as a group . ”
parents , pray to jehovah for help , and try your best .
( read 2 chronicles 15 : 7 . )
put your child’s friendship with jehovah ahead of your own interests .
but it wasn’t until 1946 that i really understood bible truth .
eventually , i learned sign language and had fun playing with the other children .
she accepted a magazine subscription and wanted me to meet her husband , gary .
eventually , five from their class became jehovah’s witnesses .
at that time , she gave me a piece of candy and asked if we could be friends .
when she wanted to get baptized , her parents told her , “ become one of jehovah’s witnesses , and you will have to leave our home ! ”
she continued her study and later got baptized .
when we got married in 1960 , her parents did not come to our wedding .
my son nicholas and his wife , deborah , serve at london bethel
faye and james , jerry and evelyn , shannan and steven
we are now part of the calgary sign - language congregation , where i continue to serve as an elder .
how can we keep our love for jehovah strong ?
how can we deepen our love for bible truth ?
why is it important to have affection for our brothers ?
what may have caused the love of some christians to grow cold ?
people today have less and less love for god .
this is the greatest and first commandment . ”

( read psalm 119 : 97 - 100 . )
show love for bible truth ( see paragraph 14 )
on his last night on earth , jesus said to his disciples : “ i am giving you a new commandment , that you love one another ; just as i have loved you , you also love one another .

( b ) what valuable lesson did a brother in thailand learn about his work ?
as a result , it left me almost no time for spiritual matters .
i finally realized that in order to put kingdom interests first , i needed to change my line of work . ”
“ after planning for about a year , ” he explained , “ i decided to become a street vendor and sell ice cream .
in the beginning , i struggled financially and got discouraged .
when i met my former workmates , they would laugh at me and ask why i thought selling ice cream was better than working with computers in an air - conditioned environment .
i prayed to jehovah , asking him to help me to cope and to reach my goal of having more time for spiritual activities .
i got better acquainted with my customers ’ tastes and became more skillful in making ice cream .
soon , i was selling all my ice cream every day .
actually , i was better - off financially than when i worked with computers .
it has made me happier because i do not have the stress and worry that i had with my former job .
and most important , i now feel closer to jehovah . ” ​ — read matthew 5 : 3 , 6 .
after his baptism , he said : “ the only regret i have is that i lost so much time before i realized that serving jehovah brings far more happiness than pursuing the entertainment offered by this world . ”
jesus said : “ where your treasure is , there your heart will be also . ”
jesus stated that “ no one can slave for two masters . ”

we were so sad to leave our bible students behind . ”
but then , a month later , they received thrilling news .
miriam says : “ we were invited to serve as special pioneers .
what a joy to be able to stay in our assignment ! ”
they trusted in the promise found at psalm 37 : 5 : “ commit your way to jehovah ; rely on him , and he will act in your behalf . ”

( read proverbs 2 : 4 - 7 . )
consider the experience of a brother named peter .
to test peter , the rabbi asked , “ so , my boy , what language was the book of daniel written in ? ”
when i went home and checked the watchtower and awake !
magazines from the previous months , i found an article explaining that daniel was written in aramaic . ”
as you do this , you will build up “ treasure in the heavens , where no thief gets near and no moth consumes .
for where your treasure is , there your hearts will be also . ” ​ — luke 12 : 33 , 34 .
“ i had trouble getting along with a brother who worked with me .
once when we were yelling at each other , two people came in and witnessed our blowup . ” ​ — chris .
“ a sister with whom i often preached suddenly ended our arrangements for the ministry .
i had no idea why . ” ​ — janet .
“ i was on a three - person phone call .
one of the others said good - bye , and i thought he was off the line .
i then said unkind things about him to the other person on the phone , but the first person had not hung up . ” ​ — michael .
“ in our congregation , two pioneers began having problems .
their bickering was discouraging to others . ” ​ — gary .

“ plans fail when there is no consultation . ”
michael says , “ my brother genuinely forgave me . ”
“ continue putting up with one another and forgiving one another freely even if anyone has a cause for complaint against another . ”
now they get along well as they preach the good news .
that difference may seem unimportant ; yet , it can lead to serious problems . ”
as my irritation grew , i started being curt with her .
i thought , ‘ she does not show me the respect i deserve , so i am not going to show her respect . ’ ”
“ i began seeing my own personality flaws , and i was very disappointed in myself .
i realized that i had to adjust my thinking .
after praying to jehovah about the matter , i bought the sister a small gift and wrote her a card to apologize for my bad attitude .
we hugged each other and agreed to put the matter behind us .
we have not had any more problems . ”
for many people today , money is the big issue .
why must the issue of sovereignty be settled ?
how important is the vindication of jehovah’s sovereignty ?
why , from the day our forefathers fell asleep in death , all things are continuing exactly as they were from creation’s beginning . ”
( read isaiah 55 : 10 , 11 . )
( read job 1 : 7 - 12 . )

how can elders and family heads imitate jehovah ?
published by jehovah’s witnesses but now out of print .
psalm 147 repeatedly encourages god’s people to praise jehovah .

“ make friends for yourselves by means of the unrighteous riches . ” ​ — luke 16 : 9 .
how can we avoid becoming slaves of today’s commercial world ?
in this system of things , why will there always be some poor people ?
what can we learn from jesus ’ counsel ?
how do we know that today’s commercial system was not part of god’s purpose ?
give examples of how some are showing faithfulness in their use of unrighteous riches .
i am more generous in being forgiving , in being patient with others , and in being able to accept disappointments and counsel . ”
( read 2 corinthians 8 : 13 - 15 . )
how did abraham show that he trusted in god ?
( b ) how can we apply paul’s counsel today ?
after calling timothy “ a fine soldier of christ jesus , ” paul told him : “ no man serving as a soldier involves himself in the commercial businesses of life , in order to gain the approval of the one who enrolled him as a soldier . ”
jehovah blesses those who are “ rich in fine works . ”

( read 2 corinthians 1 : 3 , 4 . )
every single time , the peace of god truly guarded our hearts and minds . ” ​ — read philippians 4 : 6 , 7 .
how did jesus show empathy when lazarus died ?
if you are grieving , you too can find soothing comfort from such scriptures as the following :
( read 1 thessalonians 5 : 11 . )
what do we need to remember about grief ?
even when someone does express how he feels , it is not always easy for others to understand what he is trying to say .
at that moment , i don’t feel quite so alone in my grief . ”
“ receiving a short encouraging message or an invitation to spend time with a fellow christian helps me more than i can say , ” says junia .
“ those expressions make me feel loved and cared for . ”
“ sometimes when sisters have come to comfort me , ” recalls dalene , “ i have asked them if they are willing to say a prayer .
they start praying , often battling to speak at first , but every time , within a few sentences , their voice gets stronger and they say the most heartfelt prayer .
their strong faith , their love , and their concern have been very faith - strengthening . ”
“ a true friend shows love at all times , and is a brother who is born for times of distress . ”
“ i expected my first wedding anniversary to be very traumatic , ” relates one brother , “ and it was not easy .
but a few brothers and sisters planned a small gathering of my closest friends so that i wouldn’t be on my own . ”
“ often the help and companionship offered when there is no special anniversary can be very beneficial , ” explains junia .
“ those spontaneous moments are so valuable and bring much comfort . ”
they have truly made me feel jehovah’s loving arms around me . ”
why are jehovah’s promises a source of great comfort ?
god promises that “ he will do away with death forever , and the sovereign lord jehovah will wipe away the tears from all faces . ”
other scriptures that many have found comforting are psalm 20 : 1 , 2 ; 31 : 7 ; 38 : 8 , 9 , 15 ; 55 : 22 ; 121 : 1 , 2 ; isaiah 57 : 15 ; 66 : 13 ; philippians 4 : 13 ; and 1 peter 5 : 7 .
see also the article “ comfort the bereaved , as jesus did ” in the november 1 , 2010 , issue of the watchtower .
“ we don’t know what to say except that we love you .
we can’t understand exactly how you feel , but jehovah does and will keep raising you up .
we hope that our prayers will help a little . ”
“ may jehovah sustain you at this time of such great loss . ”
“ may you find comfort in knowing that your dear one is safe in the memory of god , who will remember every detail about him and bring him back again . ”
“ your loved one will never have to face the last enemy , death , ever again .
in the meantime , his acts of faith live on until he stands up alive and whole in the paradise . ”
“ while words fail to capture the pain of losing a loved one , we look forward to the time when words will fail to capture the joy of having our heavenly father return your dear one to you . ”
during the great tribulation , christians will rely on jehovah and not try to defend themselves

and there may be trillions of galaxies in the universe !
i want you to enjoy your life as one of my witnesses ! ”
( read psalm 147 : 8 , 9 . )
mutsuo says : “ i felt that jehovah was right next to each one of us and caring for us .
12 , 13 . ( a ) to benefit from god’s help , what should we avoid ?
on the other hand , god “ hurls the wicked to the ground . ”
“ jehovah finds pleasure in those who fear him , in those waiting for his loyal love . ”
15 - 17 . ( a ) how might we at times feel about our trials , but how does jehovah use his word to help us ?
today , jehovah guides us with his word , the bible .
( read psalm 147 : 19 , 20 . )
what plans can lead to a happy future for you ?
what could a life in the pioneer service lead to ?
you young ones will probably agree that before starting a journey , it is wise to plan where you will go .
life is like a journey , and the time to plan where you want to go is when you are young .
how do you know that jehovah wants you to plan for a happy future ?
your creator is “ the god of love , ” “ the happy god , ” who made humans “ in his image . ”
you will be happy when you imitate our loving god .
jesus christ set the perfect example for you young ones .
jesus also drew close to jehovah by studying the scriptures .
“ plans fail when there is no consultation , but there is accomplishment through many advisers . ”
as with any career , you need time to become skilled .
at first , i couldn’t start any bible studies , but later i moved to another territory , and within a month i started several studies .
one student began coming to the kingdom hall .
for example , jacob , from north america , writes : “ when i was seven , many of my classmates were vietnamese .
i wanted to tell them about jehovah , so after a while i made plans to learn their language .
for the most part , i learned by comparing the english and vietnamese editions of the watchtower .
i also made friends in a nearby vietnamese - language congregation .
when i was 18 , i started pioneering .
later , i attended the bible school for single brothers .
this helped me with my present pioneer assignment , where i am the only elder in a vietnamese - language group .
many vietnamese people are amazed that i have learned their language .
they invite me in , and often i can study the bible with them .
some have progressed to baptism . ” ​ — compare acts 2 : 7 , 8 .
i enjoy encouraging the young brothers in our congregation and seeing their spiritual progress .
after i attended the bible school for single brothers , i received a new pioneer assignment .
it’s true that i have never found anyone in the territory who progressed to baptism , but others have .
how may pioneer service lead to other opportunities ?
a brother named kevin says : “ ever since i was a little boy , i have wanted to serve jehovah full - time someday .
finally , i started pioneering when i was 19 .
i supported myself working part - time for a brother who was a builder .
i learned to install roofs , windows , and doors .
later , i spent two years with a hurricane relief team , rebuilding kingdom halls and homes for the brothers .
when i heard about the construction needs in south africa , i applied and was invited to go .
here in africa , i move from one kingdom hall project to another every few weeks .
we live together , study the bible together , and work together .
i also enjoy preaching with the local brothers each week .
the plans i made as a boy have made me happy in ways i did not foresee . ”
bethel service is a happy way of life because everything you do there is for jehovah .
after a year and a half , i was invited to bethel , where i learned to operate printing presses and later to do computer programming .
at bethel , i enjoy hearing firsthand about the progress of the disciple - making activity worldwide .
i love serving here because what we do helps people to draw close to jehovah . ”
you can be sure that jehovah wants you to “ get a firm hold ” on a happy future .
( read 1 timothy 6 : 18 , 19 . )
then plan to do what is pleasing to him .
he has studied human behavior since man was created .
it’s something you have to find out for yourself . ”
and “ do not let them lead you into disaster ! ”
jesus said : “ do not fear those who kill the body and after this are not able to do anything more . ”
do not be struck with terror or fear , for jehovah your god is with you wherever you go . ”
listen to jehovah and trust in him in all that you do .
the second article highlights how jehovah can do the unexpected by accomplishing things we could never imagine .
like the farmer , we need to wait patiently .
what can we learn from the example of the prophet micah ?
( read micah 7 : 1 - 3 . )
if we have faith like that of micah , we will be willing to wait for jehovah .
so we “ endure fully with patience and joy . ”
abraham had to wait many years before his grandsons esau and jacob were born ( see paragraphs 9 , 10 )
( read hebrews 11 : 8 - 12 . )
but just imagine abraham’s joy when he is resurrected back to a paradise earth .
although you meant to harm me , god intended it to turn out well and to preserve many people alive , as he is doing today . ”
( b ) what helped david to wait patiently ?
i will sing to jehovah , for he has richly rewarded me . ”
( read 2 peter 3 : 9 . )
what will help us to be willing to wait patiently ?
what lessons do we learn from what happened to the apostle paul in philippi ?
( read acts 16 : 8 - 10 . )
soon after he arrived in macedonia , he ended up in prison !
why did jehovah allow this to happen to paul ?
both he and silas started “ praying and praising god with song . ”
4 , 5 . ( a ) how could our situation be similar to that of paul ?
( b ) how did paul’s situation change unexpectedly ?
what will we now discuss and review together ?
( read 1 peter 5 : 6 , 7 . )
we need to act in harmony with our prayers .
sometimes he surprises us by doing the unexpected .
jehovah sent an angel to destroy 185,000 of sennacherib’s soldiers in one night .
( a ) what lesson do we learn from what happened to joseph ?
no doubt jehovah’s actions exceeded all of joseph’s expectations .
think , too , about joseph’s great - grandmother sarah .
( read isaiah 43 : 10 - 13 . )
we know that jehovah cares for us and wants us to succeed .
how can we strip off and keep off the old personality ?
by 1939 there were 6,000 of them in the [ concentration camps ] . ”
and you people have cleaned the stadium so nicely .
but most of all , you are truly multiracial . ”
what will be considered in this article , and why ?
but the more i had sexual relations , the more insecure i felt . ”
this way of life continued until sakura was 23 years old .
it got so bad that i could not wait for the woman i was living with to leave the house so that i could watch pornographic videos . ”
what helped stephen to put away anger and abusive speech ?
he says : “ our family life improved dramatically .
today , stephen serves as a ministerial servant , and his wife has been a regular pioneer for several years .
bible texts that encouraged me were isaiah 55 : 7 , which says : ‘ let the wicked man leave his way , ’ and 1 corinthians 6 : 11 , which says about those who had abandoned sinful ways : ‘ and yet that is what some of you were . ’
for many years , jehovah patiently helped me by means of his holy spirit to put on the new personality . ”
we also benefit from god’s word and his holy spirit when we prepare for and attend congregation meetings .
what will be discussed in the next article ?
some of the names in this article have been changed .
see chapter 25 in the book questions young people ask ​ — answers that work , volume 1 .
( read colossians 3 : 10 - 14 . )
he stated : “ there is neither greek nor jew , circumcision nor uncircumcision , foreigner , scythian , slave , or freeman . ”
( a ) how do servants of jehovah need to treat others ?
( see opening picture . ) ( b ) what have been the results ?
then he attended a meeting of jehovah’s witnesses .
you get to experience our worldwide brotherhood and see its miraculous unity firsthand . ”
when we showed them scriptures from their portuguese bible , such as revelation 21 : 3 , 4 or psalm 37 : 10 , 11 , 29 , they paid attention and sometimes even shed tears . ”
we are so thankful to jehovah . ” ​ — read acts 10 : 34 , 35 .
what example did jesus set in showing mildness and patience ?
then he added : “ if you continue showing favoritism , you are committing sin . ”
why is it important that we clothe ourselves with love ?
love is also “ patient and kind ” and “ does not get puffed up . ”
paul said that without love , he was “ nothing . ”
the love is in this respect , not that we have loved god , but that he loved us and sent his son as a propitiatory sacrifice for our sins . ”
jesus said : “ no one has love greater than this , that someone should surrender his life in behalf of his friends . ”
let us consider how we can do so .
john wrote : “ little children , we should love , not in word or with the tongue , but in deed and truth . ”
but then i asked myself , ‘ how can i imitate jesus in dealing with this person ? ’
after reflecting on what jesus would have done , i decided to let the matter go and not make an issue of it .
later , i learned that my coworker had been coping with a serious health problem and was under a lot of stress .
i concluded that she probably did not really mean what she wrote .
reflecting on jesus ’ example of showing love even when provoked helped me to show similar love to my coworker . ”
by leaving heaven , “ he emptied himself ” in our behalf , even “ to the point of death . ”
peace : “ putting up with one another in love ” allows us to enjoy “ the uniting bond of peace . ”
would you not agree that such a peaceful spirit is truly unique in today’s divided world ?
paul wrote : “ love builds up . ”
the following day , they had outgrown the venue . ”
below the picture was the caption : “ invasion of the streets . ”
one congregation wrote , “ the only line that passes near this place is a telegraph line . ”
in mexico , 2,262,646 people attended the memorial in 2016 .
matthew’s account focuses on events that involved joseph .
1 , 2 . ( a ) what can result from a lack of self - control ?
pray for wisdom to say or do the right thing .
how can you prepare yourself to resist temptations ?
what experience did one brother have , and why are our reactions in similar situations important ?
in what ways can parents help their children to develop self - control ?
how can you help your children to develop self - control ?
( read exodus 34 : 5 - 7 . )
( b ) why should you be interested in what the bible says about compassion ?
( a ) why did jehovah send angels to sodom ?
( read exodus 22 : 26 , 27 . )
we read : “ jehovah the god of their forefathers kept warning them by means of his messengers , warning them again and again , because he felt compassion for his people and for his dwelling place . ”
“ he started to teach them many things . ”
instead , we need to do all we can now to help people .
one meaning of compassion is “ to suffer together . ”
“ be courageous and strong and go to work .
how can young ones and their parents show courage ?

( b ) how can young ones imitate moses ’ example ?
he will help them provide for the needs of their families .
she writes : “ growing up , i was really shy .
i could barely talk to people at the kingdom hall , much less knock on the doors of complete strangers . ”
with the help of her parents and others in the congregation , this young christian achieved her goal of becoming a regular pioneer .
how can psalm 37 : 25 and hebrews 13 : 5 help parents ?
( read psalm 37 : 25 ; hebrews 13 : 5 . )
a brother who has two children wrote : “ many parents expend much effort and resources helping their children reach goals in such areas as sports , recreation , and education .
it makes so much more sense to expend effort and resources in helping our children reach goals that will help them to maintain a good standing with jehovah .
it has been a great source of satisfaction not only to see our children reach spiritual goals but to share the journey with them . ”
give examples of courage in the christian congregation .
( read titus 2 : 3 - 5 . )
( a ) how can baptized brothers be courageous ?
( read philippians 2 : 13 ; 4 : 13 . )
we urge all baptized brothers to be courageous and work hard for the congregation !
therefore , “ be courageous . . . and go to work . ”

the apostle peter quoted isaiah 40 : 8 .
( read 1 peter 1 : 24 , 25 . )
( a ) how do languages change over time ?

( read 1 corinthians 6 : 9 - 11 . )
( read ephesians 5 : 15 , 16 . )
he read 2 corinthians 1 : 3 , 4 , which says : “ the father of tender mercies and the god of all comfort . . . comforts us in all our trials . ”
what responsibility do brothers who teach from the platform have ?
are we not grateful to jehovah for his written word , the bible ?
see the box “ a turning point . ”
take time to explain , illustrate , and apply verses that you read
“ a turning point came about 15 years after i was baptized .
during a talk at the kingdom hall . . . , the speaker referred to james 1 : 23 , 24 .
those verses liken god’s word to a mirror in which we can see ourselves the way jehovah sees us .
i began to wonder if what i saw in myself was different from what jehovah saw .
at first , i resisted this new idea .
i still felt that loving me was too much to expect of jehovah .
“ a few days later , i read a scripture that changed my life .
the verse was isaiah 1 : 18 , where jehovah is quoted as saying : ‘ come , now , you people , and let us set matters straight between us . . . .
though the sins of you people should prove to be as scarlet , they will be made white just like snow . ’
i felt as if jehovah were speaking to me , saying : ‘ come on , vicky , let’s set matters straight between us .
i know you , i know your sins , i know your heart ​ — and i love you . ’
“ i was unable to sleep that night .
i still doubted that jehovah could love me , but i began thinking about jesus ’ ransom sacrifice .
all of a sudden , it dawned on me that jehovah had been patient with me for so long , showing me that he loved me in so many ways .
yet , i was , in effect , saying to him : ‘ your love is not great enough to reach me .
your son’s sacrifice is not enough to cover me . ’
it was as if i had been throwing the ransom back at jehovah .
but now , at last , by meditating on this gift of the ransom , i began to feel loved by jehovah . ”
these articles discuss zechariah’s sixth , seventh , and eighth visions .
first , let me tell you about my background .
i was born in 1923 in hemsworth , a town in yorkshire , england .
the following year , i was appointed as a special pioneer , along with mary henshall .
we were sent to unassigned territory in the county of cheshire .
it is a great joy to know that there are now many witnesses in that area .
my brother and his wife , lottie , were already serving as special pioneers in northern ireland , and in 1952 the four of us attended a district convention in belfast .
that night the four of us slept in the car .
amazingly , we had no problem parking the trailer on the property of friendly farmers .
we really enjoyed our assignment in the circuit work .
the first international convention in ireland was held in dublin in 1965 .
a total of 3,948 attended , and 65 got baptized .

arthur releases my book of bible stories in gaelic in 1983
in 2011 our lives changed completely when the britain and ireland branches were merged and we were assigned to london bethel .
in the last few years , i have felt heartbreak , depression , and grief .
in the past , arthur had always been there for me .
but when you go through these kinds of situations , you draw closer to jehovah .

for i came to cause division , with a man against his father , and a daughter against her mother , and a daughter - in - law against her mother - in - law .
how can christians teach their children to honor an unbelieving parent ?

she took us to the baptist church every sunday .
they wanted me to make the military my career .
